## Limitations: 
The lack of spatial data made it difficult to visualize the trends in terms of geographic locations for METRO Houston.

## Insights: 
<li>As illustrated by the stacked bar chart in the dashboard, pre-pandemic expenses remained relatively stable; however, COVID-19 disruptions triggered increased spending due to diminished fare revenue, heightened operational complexities, and strategic investments in restoring services. </li>

<li>Internally, expenditure categories experienced meaningful shifts: fringe benefits decreased in relative proportion, while Service expenses notably increased, reflecting strategic organizational adjustments, as highlighted by the trend lines showing the percentage ratios of expense categories over time. </li>

<li>Additionally, directly operated motor buses continued to account for the largest share of expenses, but the growth of specialized transit services such as light rail and commuter buses, as detailed by the grouped bar chart comparing expenses across modes and service types, underscores Houston Metro's commitment to adaptability and responsiveness in the evolving post-pandemic transit landscape.</li>
