## Problem Statement: 
This dataset analyzes Houston Metro's operating expenses (OPEX) from 2017 to 2023, emphasizing significant shifts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Limitations: 
The lack of spatial data made it difficult to visualize the trends in terms of geographic locations for METRO Houston.

## Insights: 
As illustrated by the stacked bar chart in the dashboard, pre-pandemic expenses remained relatively stable; however, COVID-19 disruptions triggered increased spending due to diminished fare revenue, heightened operational complexities, and strategic investments in restoring services. 

Additionally, directly operated motor buses continued to account for the largest share of expenses, but the growth of specialized transit services such as light rail and commuter buses, as detailed by the grouped bar chart comparing expenses across modes and service types, underscores Houston Metro's commitment to adaptability and responsiveness in the evolving post-pandemic transit landscape.
